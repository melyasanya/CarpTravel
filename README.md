Hello! I was able to do almost everything planned. The only block i didn't do was block 'About me' because I didn't have enoght time for it and it was pretty one of the easiest blocks.
I fully completed header with navigation and scroll. Also i did everyrhing needed from the hero section.
I almost finished services block. I was able to do everything except slider in this particular block and different background image.
As for the contacts block, I was able to finish it comletely.
Speaking about the rest of the blocks, I was able to finish career block completely and not fully corrected finish the gallery block.
Thank you for you attention, hope you will like my ptoject
